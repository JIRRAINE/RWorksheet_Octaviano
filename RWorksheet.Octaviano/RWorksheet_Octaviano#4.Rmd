## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1.The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.

 
Dataframe <- data.frame (Gender=c("F","F","F","F","M","F","F","F","M","F","M","F","M","M","M","M","F","F","M","F","F","M","M","F","M","M","M","M"),

ShoeSize=c(6.5,9.0,8.5,8.5,10.5,7.0,9.5,9.0,13.0,7.5,10.5,8.5,12.0,10.5,13.0,11.5,8.5,5.0,10.0,6.5,7.5,8.5,10.5,8.5,10.5,11.0,9.0,13.0),

Height=c(66.0,68.0,64.5,65.0,70.0,64.0,70.0,71.0,72.0,64.0,74.5,67.0,71.0,71.0,77.0,72.0,59.0,62.0,72.0,66.0,64.0,67.0,73.0,69.0,72.0,70.0,69.0,70.0))
Dataframe

##    The dataframe contains information about individuals' genders, shoe sizes, and heights, which is likely associated with a group of people.

#b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.

females_subset <- dataShoeHeight[dataShoeHeight$Gender == "F", c("Gender", "Shoe_Size", "Height")]
females_subset

males_subset <- dataShoeHeight[dataShoeHeight$Gender == "M", c("Gender", "Shoe_Size", "Height")]
males_subset

#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
mean_shoe_size <- mean(df$Shoe_Size)
mean_height <- mean(df$Height)

mean_shoe_size
mean_height
