## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# 1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
Gender <- c("F", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "M" , "F", "M", "M", "M", "M", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "M", "M", "F", "M", "M", "M", "M")

shoeSize <- c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 7.5, 10.5, 8.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5,5.0,10.0,6.5,7.5,8.5,10.5,8.5,10.5,11.0,9.0,13.0)

Height <- c(66.0, 68.0, 64.5, 65.0, 70.0,64.0,70.0,71.0,72.0,64.0,74.5,67.0,71.0,71.0,77.0,72.0,59.0,62.0,72.0,66.0,64.0,67.0,73.0,69.0,72.0,70.0,69.0,70.0)



householdData <- data.frame(
  Gender = Gender,
  ShoeSize = shoeSize,
  Height = Height
)
householdData

#a 
# The data contains 28 unique data entries on individuals, including gender, shoe size, and height.

#b
males <- householdData[householdData$Gender == "M",]
males
females <- householdData[householdData$Gender == "F",]
females

#c
meanOfShoeSize <- mean(householdData$ShoeSize)
meanOfShoeSize
meanOfHeight <- mean(householdData$Height)
meanOfHeight

#d.
# The relationship between the two is that the shoe size is directly proportional to the height. If the height is small, the shoe size is also small.


# 2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.

months_vector <- c("March","April","January","November","January","September","October","September","November","August","January","November","November","February","May","August","July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")

months_vector
factor_months_vector <- factor(months_vector)
factor_months_vector

#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Inter-pret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?

summary(months_vector)
summary(factor_months_vector)

#In the summary of months_vector, it shows the number of observations, class, and mode of the vector.
#In the summary of factor_months_vector, it shows the frequency of each month.
#Both are useful in different cases where the number of observations, class, mode, or frequency are needed.


# 4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
factor_data <- c(1,4,3)
new_order_data <- factor(factor_data,levels = c("East","West","North"))
print(new_order_data)


# 5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv



###   Using Conditional Statements (IF-ELSE)

# 6. Full Search
randomNum <- readline(prompt = "Enter number from 1 to 50: ")
randomNum <- as.numeric(randomNum)
paste("The number you have chosen is", randomNum)
if (randomNum > 50) {
  paste("The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50")
} else if (randomNum == 20) {
  paste("TRUE")
} else {
  paste(randomNum)
}

# 7. Change
minimumBills <- function(price) {
  
  minBills <- price %/% 50
  paste("The minimum no. of bills:", minBills)
}
minimumBills(90)


# 8. The following is each student’s math score for one semester. Based on this, answer the following questions.
#a. Create a dataframe from the above table. Write the R codes and its output.
names <- c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna")
grade1 <- c(85,65,75,95)
grade2 <- c(65,75,55,75)
grade3 <- c(85,90,80,100)
grade4 <- c(100,90,85,90)
math <- data.frame(
  Name = names,
  Grade1 = grade1,
  Grade2 = grade2,
  Grade3 = grade3,
  Grade4 = grade4
)
math

#b. Without using the rowMean function, output the average score of students whose average math score over 90 points during the semester. write R code and its output. Example Output: Annie’s average grade this semester is 88.75.



#c. Without using the mean function, output as follows for the tests in which the average score was less than 80 out of 4 tests. Example output: The nth test was difficult.


#d. d. Without using the max function, output as follows for students whose highest score for a semester exceeds 90 points. Example Output: Annie’s highest grade this semester is 95.
